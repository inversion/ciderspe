CIDEr is an undergraduate student project for the University of Bristol, the deadline for which has now passed.
This means that (for now at-least) development will come to an end,
however it's possible that at some point in the future some members
of the project will continue development as a hobby. CIDEr is an open source project and anyone who is interested in contributing is free to do so.

Yours sincerely
