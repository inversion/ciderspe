
IMPORTANT:
I'm doing all my stuff in eclipse, but edit your code in whatever way you feel comfortable with.
Just make sure however you do it that you only commit & push the sort of files everyone can use,
so usually just the source files. For example, do not commit & push things like .class files
(many IDEs use incremental build) or .settings .etc.
The reason is that these sorts of files may accidently be pulled into peoples working clone and
screw up their IDE settings. It's not a big deal if this does happen but best to avoid it.

btw: after you've pulled other peoples code it might be a good idea to do a refresh & rebuild-all
if you're using an IDE.

BREAKING THE BUILD:
If we must temporarily abondon some particular feature that was working before to get important
new stuff working then post something on Google Groups.

AUTO-FORMATTING:
I like to use an auto-formatter on my code. The rule with auto-formatters is only use them on your
own stuff, unless the person whos code you're editing was formatted with the same style.



ADDITIONAL NOTES:
Here we can put general comments on the general state of the repository.

-------------------------
Just committed some experimental stuff in the common.processes package.
On the first commit I made I made a fancy logo for cider at the top of the commit message
but I forgot that the first part of the message is used as a brief description of the change
in the repository explorer. So, I reversed the process and commited again then pushed to the repository.
The moral of the story is: The top bit of the commit message is very important so make sure you
put something descriptive up there.
